Give a specific reason <em>why </em>it matters.</li><li>Identify any trigger that pops up</li><li>Write down an overview of the habit with the step-by-step action plan you'll follow</li><li>Track your success with a daily metric</li><li>You'll need to make a decision at the end of the month: Should keep it or not?</li></ol>



<p><strong>Write down the date</strong> when you'll start this habit change.Having an official “countdown” will help you stay on track.</p>
